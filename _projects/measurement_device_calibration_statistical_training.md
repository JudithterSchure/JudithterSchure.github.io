"The SnowMicroPen measures about 0.25 million force data points in one meter of snow. This signal can be used to calculate density and specific surface of the snowpack, but the relation is in no way linear. Judith was a significant help for our team to understand the problem in a correct statistical context. She also was a great teacher to our PhD-students giving an introduction to modern statistics. We are looking forward to engage her again for statistical questions or teaching."
