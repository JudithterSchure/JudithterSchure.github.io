"We have developed a novel skin therapy that should be tested in dogs with skin infections in a clinical study. Judith was in charge of the statistical power analysis. She very quickly identified the key points of the therapeutic, the clinical picture and study planning. Through her proactive interaction with everyone involved in the study (researchers, pharmacists, veterinarians), she helped us to significantly improve the study design. Judith communicates very clearly in a friendly manner and has produced the statistical analysis within the estimated timeframe.
<br />
We can fully recommend Judith to others and will be happy to consult her again when planning future studies. "
