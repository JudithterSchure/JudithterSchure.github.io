title: "[General] Great summary article about my Ph.D. thesis"
date: 2023-01-19
description: "Nicos Starreveld writes a fantastic series of articles in the member's magazine of the KWG ('Koninklijk Wiskundig Genootschap', Royal Dutch Mathematical Society). He reads recent Ph.D. theses with great care and interviews Ph.D. candidates in mathematics that are preparing for their defense. The series is called 'In Defense'/'In de Verdediging' and appears (mostly) in English. This is an article that discusses the work of my current colleague dr. Birgit Sollie and this is an article in the series on the work of my former colleague dr. Yfke Dulek. I especially like the description of mathematical work as tirelessly exploring how something can be done, resulting in constructing an impossibily proof that also makes you happy.I was very honored for my Ph.D. thesis to be featured in the piece that appeared in December. You can read it here. It provides a great summary of the main themes of my Ph.D. thesis: research waste, accumulation bias, and of course: ALL-IN meta-analysis"

Nicos Starreveld writes a fantastic series of articles in the member's magazine of the KWG ('Koninklijk Wiskundig Genootschap', Royal Dutch Mathematical Society). He reads recent Ph.D. theses with great care and interviews Ph.D. candidates in mathematics that are preparing for their defense. The series is called 'In Defense'/'In de Verdediging' and appears (mostly) in English. [This](https://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2021-22-3-192.pdf) is an article that discusses the work of my current colleague dr. Birgit Sollie and [this](https://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2021-22-4-255.pdf) is an article in the series on the work of my former colleague dr. Yfke Dulek.

I was very honored for my Ph.D. thesis to be featured in the piece that appeared in December. You can read it [here](https://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2022-23-4-246.pdf). It provides a great summary of the main themes of my Ph.D. thesis: research waste, accumulation bias, and of course: ALL-IN meta-analysis
