title: "[Peers] Dataviz matters! Update to my Ph.D. thesis"
date: 2023-01-20
description: "The final question at my Ph.D. defense was by prof. Richard Gill. He saw an easy improvement to the data visualization in the introduction of my Ph.D. thesis. Not that I was too happy about it myself. The main point of the figures was that sampling distributions and p-values depend a lot on the sample size (the number of heart attacks n, in the example) â€“ you can only visualize them in this way given a sample size or stopping rule. That was still clear from the figure, but it was very distracting and counterintuitive that the distributions in the figure shrank, for which I had to add a long caption below Figure 1 of my Ph.D. thesis. It was October 2021, and I had set the deadline for my Ph.D. thesis to November 1st. I simply did not see the easy fix. Thanks to Richard, my Ph.D. now has better figures. Also thanks to Nicos Starreveld, who wrote a very nice article about my Ph.D. thesis that reuses the improved figure. The updated Ph.D. thesis can be found in the Amsterdam UMC repository. In this blogpost I also post the improvements to Figure 2 and Figure 3 that follow."

Nicos Starreveld writes a fantastic series of articles in the member's magazine of the KWG ('Koninklijk Wiskundig Genootschap', Royal Dutch Mathematical Society). He reads recent Ph.D. theses with great care and interviews Ph.D. candidates in mathematics that are preparing for their defense. The series is called 'In Defense'/'In de Verdediging' and appears (mostly) in English. This is an article that discusses the work of my current colleague dr. Birgit Sollie and this is an article in the series on the work of my former colleague dr. Yfke Dulek. I especially like the description of mathematical work as tirelessly exploring how something can be done, resulting in constructing an impossibily proof that also makes you happy.

I was very honored for my Ph.D. thesis to be featured in the piece that appeared in December. You can read it here. It provides a great summary of the main themes of my Ph.D. thesis: research waste, accumulation bias, and of course: ALL-IN meta-analysis
