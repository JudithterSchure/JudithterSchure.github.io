I received an award for a talk!

The goals of EBR – or evbres: Evidence-Based Research – have been central to the work in my Ph.D. thesis on ALL-IN meta-analysis. During the EBR conference I argued that these new statistical methods could be the future of EBR, and received a Best Oral Presentation award for it. ([Here's the Twitter announcement.](https://twitter.com/evbres/status/1578415259466928129))  
  
The great thing about online conferences is that you can still watch the presentation on [the EBR conference' Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkIyhRK9IXIPiFluG5yFRpGV06PwYu4LD).
