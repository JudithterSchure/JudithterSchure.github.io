Inspired by a 'How to talk about mathematics' presentation by Ionica Smeets in August last year, I created this outline slide for my talk at University of Amsterdam. Looking forward to this week, with three talks: in Tilburg on Tuesday, in Amsterdam (UvA) on Friday and again in Amsterdam (CWI) on Saturday.

Accumulation Bias in Meta-Analysis: How to Describe and How to Handle It  
  
Studies accumulate over time and meta-analyses are mainly retrospective. These two characteristics introduce dependencies between the analysis time, at which a series of studies is up for meta-analysis, and results within the series. Dependencies introduce bias —Accumulation Bias— and invalidate the sampling distribution assumed for p-value tests, thus inflating type-I errors. But dependencies are also inevitable, since for science to accumulate efficiently, new research needs to be informed by past results. In our paper, we investigate various ways in which time influences error control in meta-analysis testing. We introduce an Accumulation Bias Framework that allows us to model a wide variety of practically occurring dependencies including study series accumulation, meta-analysis timing, and approaches to multiple testing in living systematic reviews. The strength of this framework is that it shows how all dependencies affect p-value-based tests in a similar manner. This leads to two main conclusions.
